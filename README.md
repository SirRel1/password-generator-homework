This is my Html, CSS and Javascript files for my first password generator application.
I'm deploying on 11/12/21 to my Github repository. I will provide a URL to the deployed
webpage and a link to my Github.

The generator behaves according to all User specifications:
Prompting User for desired length...
Asking if lower/uppercase characters should be included,
and allowing for special characters.

When 'Generate Password' button is clicked, there is a uniquely printed password inside
of the box where placeholder text was. Upon further clicking more unique passwords are generated.
